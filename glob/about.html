<p> roshambo is a gall app with a web interface and a dojo interface</p>
<hr>
<h2> gall app </h2>
<p> most of the logic is to accomplish the following: </p>
<p> if two users tell their agents to %poise against one another, the agents will chat until they settle on a time window. </p>
<p> they'll set %behn timers for t0, and theyll listen for the opponent from t0 until t0+n </p>
<p>-</p>
<p> then theres some ugly stuff about how I'm dealing with http-api inputs &amp; conditional (?verbose) debug prints.</p>
<hr>
<h2> web interface </h2>
<p> This frontend is hand-written HTML/CSS/JS bundled with http-api and urbit-ob using <a href="https://browserify.org/">browserify</a>.</p>
<p> The <a href="script.js">UI logic</a> is a short (messy) list of click event functions and a few calls to http-api. </p>
<hr>
<h2> dojo interface </h2>
<p> Step 1: set the app to verbose mode. </p>
<blockquote>
<tt>:roshambo|verbose &amp;</tt>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p> Step 2: <strong>shoot</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<tt>:roshambo|shoot %r</tt><br>
<tt>:roshambo|shoot %p</tt><br>
<tt>:roshambo|shoot %s</tt>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p> Step 3: <strong>poise</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<tt>:roshambo|poise ~sampel-palnet</tt><br>
</blockquote>
<p> When you and an opponent <strong>poise</strong> against one another, your agents negotiate an exact time at which they will share <strong>shoot</strong> values.</p>
<p> this time will be printed to the screen. You can change your <strong>shoot</strong> any time before the shoot-time. </p>
<br>

<p> Step 4: give it a sec </p>
<p> If successful, the results will be printed to the screen sometime between shoot-time and shoot-time + latency. </p>
<p> Otherwise you may need to tweak your latency and poise-delay values. </p>
<hr>
<h3> Other commands </h3>
<p> latency and poise-delay are @dr values used in negotiating a game. They have default values which may not be ideal for play depending on the quality of your p2p connection. These could be increased for a slow connection, or decreased for a fast connection. </p>
<blockquote>
<tt>:roshambo|latency ~sX</tt><br>
</blockquote>
<p> sets your latency value to X seconds. </p>
<p> If I have a latency of X seconds, my agent will accept a shoot until X seconds after the shoot-time.</p>
<p> This can be generous. Too short (&lt; actual_latency) and your shoots won't make it in time.</p>
<p>If its too long (&gt; 2 * actual_latency), then someone with a modded %roshambo could technically cheat. But thats pretty unlikely.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<tt>:roshambo|poise-delay ~sY</tt><br>
</blockquote>
<p> sets your poise-delay value to Y seconds. </p>
<p> If I have a poise-delay of Y seconds, the shoot-time for my game will be at least Y seconds after I poise. </p>
<p> Give it enough for your agents to poke back and forth a few times. </p>
<p> Agents settle on the larger poise-delay. </p>
