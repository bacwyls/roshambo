<h2> gall app </h2>
<p> most of the logic is to accomplish the following: </p>
<p> if two users tell their agents to %poise against one another, the agents will chat until they settle on a time window. </p>
<p> they'll set behn timers for t0. At t0, they share shoot values and listen for the opponent until t0+n </p>
<p>-</p>
<p> then theres some ugly stuff about how I'm dealing with http-api inputs &amp; conditional (?verbose) debug prints.</p>
<hr>
<h2> web interface </h2>
<p> This frontend is hand-written HTML/CSS/JS bundled with @urbit/http-api using <a href="https://browserify.org/">browserify</a>.</p>
<p> The <a href="script.js">UI logic</a> is a short list of click event functions and a few calls to http-api. </p>

<h2> dojo interface </h2>
<p> The user can <tt>:roshambo|poise ~sampel-palnet</tt> and <tt>:roshambo|shoot (%r|%p|%s)</tt></p>
<p> if you want to see the game in dojo you can <tt>:roshambo|verbose &amp;</tt> or periodically <tt>:roshambo %print-state</tt></p>
<p> you can also adjust some constants that are used in negotiating the time-window for a game. </p>
<blockquote>
<tt>:roshambo|latency ~sX</tt><br>
</blockquote>
<p> sets your latency value to X seconds. </p>
<p> If I have a latency of X seconds, my agent will accept a shoot until X seconds after the shoot-time.</p>
<p> Too short (&lt; actual_latency) and your shoots won't make it in time.</p>
<p> Too long (&gt; 2 * actual_latency) and someone with a modded %roshambo could technically cheat.</p>
<p> This can be (and is by default) generous, since you probably arent too worried about cheaters.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<tt>:roshambo|poise-delay ~sY</tt><br>
</blockquote>
<p> sets your poise-delay value to Y seconds. </p>
<p> If I have a poise-delay of Y seconds, the shoot-time for my game will be at least Y seconds after I poise. </p>
<p> Give it enough for players to set their shoot values and agents to poke back and forth a few times. </p>
<br>
<p> Agents settle on the proposed time-window which is further in the future. </p>
