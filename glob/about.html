<h2> web interface </h2>
<p> This frontend is hand-written HTML/CSS/JS bundled with @urbit/http-api using <a href="https://browserify.org/">browserify</a>.</p>
<p> The <a href="script.js">UI logic (pre-bundle)</a> is a short list of click event functions, some jquery, and a few pokes to the local agent. </p>
<p> A plus for this frontend is you can actually read the <a href="bundle.js">bundled js</a>. It's about 1k lines, the vast majority of which is just a copy of the http-api source. </p>

<h2> gall app </h2>
<p> both players in RPS must reveal their choice at roughly the same time, otherwise the later player can always win.</p>
<p> roshambo implements a simple handshake where two agents agree upon a time window in the near future [t0, t0+n] </p>
<p> they set behn timers for t0. At t0, they share shoot values via poke and listen for the opponent until t0+n </p>
<p> So, in theory, agent A will not know agent B's choice until he's already commited to his own. </p>
<p> In practice, this is usually the case. But I've seen these %shoot pokes arrive between 20 seconds too late and 1 second too early (?) </p>
<p> Also, one could technically run a modded roshambo that waits for the opponents shoot and responds with the winning answer. This works as long as n &gt; 2*real_latency, which it almost always will be.</p>

<h2> dojo interface </h2>
<p> You can also play with a dojo interface if you're into that shit. see /gen/roshambo/*/hoon</p>
