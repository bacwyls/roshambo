<h1> About </h1>
<p> Developed by <strong>~bacwyl-samweg</strong></p>
<p> Source: <a href="https://github.com/bacwyls/roshambo"> click here </a> </p>
<hr>
<p> roshambo is a messy gall app made for fun.</p>
<p> Out of laziness, I decided not to bother with a frontend framework. So this is just hand-made HTML/CSS/JS bundled with @urbit/http-api and urbit-ob using browserify.</p>
<p> A bonus of this is that the frontend logic is simple and legible, so you can read the source if you're worried about malicious frontend code.</p>

<h2> Play roshambo in dojo </h2>
<p> Step 1: set the app to verbose mode. </p>
<tt>:roshambo|verbose &amp;</tt>
<br><br>
<p> Step 2: <strong>shoot</strong> </p>
<tt>:roshambo|shoot %r</tt><br>
or
<tt>:roshambo|shoot %p</tt><br>
or
<tt>:roshambo|shoot %s</tt>
<br><br>
<p> Step 3: <strong>poise</strong> </p>
<tt>:roshambo|poise ~sampel-palnet</tt><br>
<p> When you and an opponent <strong>poise</strong> against one another, your agents negotiate an exact time at which they will share <strong>shoot</strong> values.</p>
<p> this time will be printed to the screen. You can change your <strong>shoot</strong> any time before the shoot-time. </p>
<br>

<p> Step 4: give it a sec </p>
<p> If successful, the results will be printed to the screen sometime between shoot-time and shoot-time + latency. </p>
<p> Otherwise you may need to tweak your latency and poise-delay values. </p>
<hr>
<h3> Other commands </h3>
<p> latency and poise-delay are @dr values used in negotiating a game. They have default values which may not be ideal for play depending on the quality of your p2p connection. These could be increased for a slow connection, or decreased for a fast connection. </p>
<tt>:roshambo|latency ~sX</tt><br>
<p> sets your latency value to X seconds. </p>
<p> If I have a latency of X seconds, my agent will accept a shoot until X seconds after the shoot-time.</p>
<p> If too long, the opponent could technically cheat. Too short and your packets won't ever make it. </p>
<br>
<tt>:roshambo|poise-delay ~sY</tt><br>
<p> sets your poise-delay value to Y seconds. </p>
<p> If I have a poise-delay of Y seconds, the shoot-time for my game will be at least Y seconds after I poise. </p>
<p> Agents settle on the larger poise-delay. </p>
